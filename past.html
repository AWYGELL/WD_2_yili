                    My past experiences play a pivotal role in shaping my future, and the keyword "find" encapsulates this journey of self-discovery. During high school and university, I embarked on a quest to find my interests, and this exploration took me through various subjects and courses. Along this path, I realized that trying new things, communicating with peers and professors, and learning from my mistakes were the key elements that allowed me to find my true passions and potential. These experiences not only helped me discover my academic inclinations but also equipped me with the resilience and adaptability needed to navigate the challenges of my future endeavors.

                    An introduction to the fundamentals of computational thinking, such as decomposition, data representation, pattern recognition, and algorithms. This course focuses on the basic concepts and ideas behind computation. The course also offers a hands-on programming practice on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Starting from first principles, we will cover a large subset of the Python programming language, including its standard libraries and programming paradigms.

                    Computation, society, and culture are tightly interwoven into each other, and are unthinkable without each other. They each provide the means and frameworks in which the others develop. In this course, we’ll investigate a wide array of computational technologies and delve into the dynamic interactions these technologies have with society and culture, emphasizing the themes of innovation and maturation, ethics, collaboration and communication, and risk and failure.

                    New media – ranging from Yahoo! to Facebook to WeChat and TikTok – have in recent years drastically influenced social, economic, and political life throughout the world. This course takes a social scientific approach to understanding the dynamics of new media and society, with particular emphasis on everyday life and social interactions. This course also adopts a global perspective, including research conducted both in the Global North and South, to trace the development of new media, their relationship to previous modes of communication and transmission, as well as how digital technologies influence emerging and changing spheres of economic, political and social exchanges. By the end of the class, students will be able to articulate the role of new media in society and the debates around emerging technologies, and different ways that can lead to actions for social change.

                    Interaction and Physical Computing is a practice-based course designed to teach basic programming and electronics skills in the context of critical media and creative technology. The course is made up of two parallel focuses: 1) introducing programming and electronics through the Processing and Arduino IDE and hands-on exercises; 2) introducing essential concepts in interaction design through project-driven learning.
