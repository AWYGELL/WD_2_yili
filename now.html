                    The actions I take NOW have a profound impact on shaping my future, and the keyword "explore" encapsulates this transformative journey. Currently, I am actively engaged in research, collaborating with professors from diverse majors, working alongside upperclass students and graduate scholars, and diligently enrolling in relevant courses. Through these efforts, I am continuously exploring the boundaries of my academic and professional interests. This deliberate exploration not only broadens my horizons but also equips me with the interdisciplinary knowledge and networking opportunities necessary to forge a unique and promising path forward.
