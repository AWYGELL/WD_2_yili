                            My past experiences play a pivotal role in shaping my future, and the keyword "find" encapsulates this journey of self-discovery. During high school and university, I embarked on a quest to find my interests, and this exploration took me through various subjects and courses. Along this path, I realized that trying new things, communicating with peers and professors, and learning from my mistakes were the key elements that allowed me to find my true passions and potential. These experiences not only helped me discover my academic inclinations but also equipped me with the resilience and adaptability needed to navigate the challenges of my future endeavors.

                            The actions I take NOW have a profound impact on shaping my future, and the keyword "explore" encapsulates this transformative journey. Currently, I am actively engaged in research, collaborating with professors from diverse majors, working alongside upperclass students and graduate scholars, and diligently enrolling in relevant courses. Through these efforts, I am continuously exploring the boundaries of my academic and professional interests. This deliberate exploration not only broadens my horizons but also equips me with the interdisciplinary knowledge and networking opportunities necessary to forge a unique and promising path forward.

                            With a resolute spirit of "go and get," I envision a future shaped by the relentless pursuit of my passions. Having discovered my interests and explored the fields and activities that ignite my enthusiasm, I am now armed with a clear vision for my career path. I understand that my aspirations require dedication and effort, and I am prepared to go the extra mile to achieve them. This vision isn't just a distant dream; it's a roadmap guiding me towards a future where I turn my ambitions into reality, driven by the determination to go and get what I truly desire.
